abstract: 'Our study is based on the idea that house prices and credit to household are jointly determined and they affect each other both in the short-run and in the long-run. We decompose the movements of the two variables of interest into permanent (long-run) and transitory (short-run) components using an unobserved components vector autoregressive model. Our dynamic model shows findings to support the hypothesis that a short-run positive shock to household credit is associated with an increase in house prices above its long-run trend. Additionally, by utilizing additional information generated by the unobserved component model, our multivariate model performs better than univariate models do in capturing the dynamics of the household credit and house prices over the last two decades, especially during the period of the recent financial crisis. We were also able to estimate the predictive ability that cyclical components of a variable have on their counterparts by employing cross-correlation coefficients in the VAR model.'
